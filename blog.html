			<h1><b>Visualize</b></h1>
			<p>Humans are prone to various ways of suffering be it physical, emotional or mentally. It all depends on how we handle the situation.<br><em>In Mans Search for Meaning</em> Victor demonstrates to us how he mannaged to avoid his own suffering by looking for better means of making his life meaningful.He did not sympathize with himself unlike the other prisoners who became apathetic with their lives and gave up. Victor maneuvered his way out of suffering by deciding to use his suffering as an opportunity to become a better person. He observed how the prison’s environment affected the prisoner’s minds. This shows us that in our normal lives we should try to alleviate our pain by engaging ourselves in productive activities. During these Covid times we should not spend time whining how many people are dying per day but instead try looking for ways to better ways to save more lives.Memories jog our minds for the better. Victor remember his love for his wife and decided to re-write his manuscript which the Nazis had taken away from him. His love for his life inspired him to keep on going .We can relate this in our daily lives by remembering the people we value the most and how we don’t want to disappoint them.</p>
			<h2><b>Young People</b></h2>
			<p>Young people are always the driving force for any nation.Covid-19 has not only proven to be capable of claiming lives but also making peoples livelihoods unstable. It’s up to the young people to take a lead and try to calm the situation instead of lazily idling around. Studies have proven that Young people are also know to handle incidences involving paranoia differently but with extra caution. Various ways in which they can engage themselves in include educating their families and friends about Covid precautions like washing ones had at regular intervals. They may also join movements like the Kenya Scouts or St. John’s ambulance and volunteer to help the health workers in some activities like fumigation.They may alsohelp they parents back at home.</p>
			<h3><b>Colonial</b></h3>
			<p>Medicine-using of AI robotics in hospitals especially treating the cancer, diabetic and x-ray patients has really played a huge part in saving lives.Infrastructure-beautiful inventions and innovations like roads, railways, ships and aero planes have really eased transportation especially that of bulky goods. Networking and communication has played a huge role as one can comfortably communicate with their dears ones who are miles away from themBeauty-I normally don’t understand how beauty of an African woman (skin tone, kinky hair and dummy nose) is seen to be ugly whereas straight hair, straight nose and light skin is viewed to be flawless ad fairest of them all. This notion is still being held by some people who especially some Africans who normally favor light skins over melanin. Some job opportunities are given to some people just because they fit the physical appearance of a certain employer. Body shaming should  stop and we should learn to respect and boost each other’s self-esteem since we all human.Christianity-I usually find it bad how the African Heritage was portrayed as demonic or cultic. Africans were brain washed into believing that behaving in a certain way or pretending to be some else will bring you closer to God. Even right now the divinity is always portrayed as white signifigning purity whereas black is signified as root of all evil. In the name of Christianity, Africans were forced out of their own lad, became slaves since the colonizers came pretending to be Priests</p>
